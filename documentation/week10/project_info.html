  <p><h1>Week 5 progress update</h1>
    The common method in the beginning of the development of this type of web elements is, first, to make sketches about the interface
    that we are going to show and a prototype where the functionality of this is shown.
    To create the first approach to the interface we decided to list what elements we believe necessary, we obtained the following:
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li> Preview space: area where we can see graphically the situation and the final result of the animation.</li>
      <li> Timeline: here we show where the keyframes we have created are located, with respect to time.</li>
      <li> Keyframe list: list with the positions, rotation, scale that we want to interpolate in each keyframe.</li>
      <li> Selector: list with each object of the scene.</li>
      <li> Code display: shows the code of the animation made.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    With these elements we can start to create the basic outline of the web page. For this, we use draw.io
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="../img/KeyframeAnimator.jpg" alt="diagram">
  </p>
  <p>
Once we have made the first scheme, we place placeholders (non-interactive images) to obtain a first image of the design and its elements.
